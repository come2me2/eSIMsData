What is an eSIM?
An eSIM is a digital SIM card that allows you to activate a mobile data plan without needing a physical SIM card. It's embedded directly into your device and can be set up remotely via QR code.

Which countries does eSimsData operate in?
eSimsData provides reliable mobile connectivity in over 100 countries. Your eSIM will automatically connect to local partner networks while roaming. To see the full list of supported countries, check the Category section on this page.

How do I activate my eSIM?
After purchase, you'll receive a QR code via email or in your account. Simply scan this QR code with your device's camera in the eSIM settings, and your data plan will be activated automatically.

Can I use my eSIM on multiple devices?
No, each eSIM is tied to a single device. If you need connectivity on multiple devices, you'll need to purchase separate eSIMs for each one.`,
